# Twitter-Classification-using-K-Nearest-Neighbour

VIRAL TWEETS CLASSIFICATION USING A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM

### INTRODUCTION

This project uses a K-Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm to predict whether a tweet will go viral.
Initially, a broad definition of a 'viral' tweet is established as one which has been 'shared more times than 10 times the user's followers count'.
The reader should note that this definition is arbitrary.

### SCOPE

#### GOALS

1. Use a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier to predict whether a tweet will go viral to 95% accuracy
2. Determine which features of a tweet are most likely to cause a tweet to go viral:
	i. number of hashtags in the tweet;
	ii. number of words or characters;
	iii. number of links;
	iv. number of followers the user has;
	v. specific language used;
	vi. number of user mentions.
